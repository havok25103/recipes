# Tap and Grind IPA

## Goal

One of my first attempts to brew my own recipe was that of a ctirus forward IPA. The end result was a too bready and had very few fruit notes.

The goal for this beer is to expand on idea for this first brew, introduce higher notes of citrus and compliment them with notes of honey.

This should be a refreshing, bright, IPA.

### Recipe

**Yield**

- 1 Gallon

**Brew Method**

- Brew in a bag

**Water**

- 1.5 Gallons

**Yeast**

- SafAle T-58 Ale Dry Yeast

**Grain Bill**

- Briess Organix 2-Row Malt: 2lbs
- Honey Malt: 1lbs

**Mash Schedule**

- Steep for 75 minutes at 159f
- Steep for 7 minutes at 168f
- Remove grains and bring to a boil for the hop schedule.

**Hop Schedule**

- 60 Minutes: 3.5g Centennial Hop Pellets
- 20 Minutes: 3.5g Centennial Hops Pellets
- 5 Minutes: 7g Galaxy Hop Pellets
- 0 Minutes: 7g Galaxy Hop Pellets

**Bottle Conditioning**

- Sugar: Sucrose 16g
- Storage: 2 Weeks 

**Taste**

- Honey
- Citrus, Peach, Guava

### Errors

- Keeping steeping temperatures at 159f and 168f was a challenge. This reached higher temperatures, resulting in a higher boil off rate.
- Denver altitude resulted in a lower boiling point that I failed to account for. 
- Water absorbtion from the grains was a factor I did not condier. I needed to add back water, 1 cup at a time, to compensate.
- Color seems way too dark, even in the event of a more contentrated yield. I should adjust the grain bill to reduce honey malt in favor of a lighter malt.

### Positive Notes

- Tasting the wort shows that this grain bill is close to where I want it, in terms of flavor. The choice of honey malt is what I want.
- The hop aroma is exactly where I want it to be. Galaxy hops at the tail end of the hop schedule should remain in place.

### Future Adjustments

- Increase water usage to 2.25 gallons to account for excess boil off
- Shift malt percentage in favor of 2-row malt ( 2.5lbs, .5lbs ) or about 17% honey malt to 83% 2-row malt. 2-row has a lower lovibond score and should lighten the beer significantly, while also reducing sweetness.
